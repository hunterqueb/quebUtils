# quebUtils

quebUtils is my personal collection of complex functions I've written in Python over the years.

to install run in bash:
```
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```
or just
```
pip install .
```

files placed in the other folder are useful files that have not been sorted and do not have a nice place to live
